## Overview

A Status of the rjvm is WIP.
It is a JVM written in Rust that I'm making for fun.
I implement it according to [this specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/index.html).

## Build and Run

It's still not working right now and outputs the results of reading `samples/HelloWorld.class`.
Look forward to seeing it work :)

```
$ cargo run samples/HelloWorld.class
```
